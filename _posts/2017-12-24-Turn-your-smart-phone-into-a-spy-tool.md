We are all thinking of our digital security more than our physical security, But Edward is again here to remind us that our physical security
should be as good as our digital security.

Edward Snowden launched an app called Haven which makes the best use of sensors on your phone to turn it into a mini security device. I have tried
the app my self and it works really good.

## The 'Evil Maid' Problem
The notion of a smartphone-based alarm system arose when Micah Lee, a technologist at the news outlet The Intercept and board member of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, suggested it to Snowden in early 2017. Lee hoped for a new approach to the perennial problem that the cybersecurity community calls the "evil maid" attack: It's very difficult to prevent someone with physical access to your computer from hacking it.

Eventually, Lee and Snowden's group of developers at the Freedom of the Press Foundation partnered with the security-focused nonprofit Guardian Project to build and test a software solution to that problem. "We thought, is there a way we can use a smartphone as a security device," says Nathan Freitas, the director of the Guardian Project. "Take all the surveillance technologies in smartphones and flip them on their head, to keep watch on all the things you care about when you’re not there?"

In practice, Haven could protect its users from more than just hands-on computer hackers; it could guard against everyone from abusive spouses to authoritarian police. In November, the groups teamed up with the Colombian activism group Movilizatorio to conduct a trial with social justice activists—a group that's been the target of dozens of assassinations over the last year, in the fallout of tense negotiations between guerrilla groups and the country's government. Movilizatorio founder Juliana Uribe Villegas says the app provided a key reassurance that month, for a group of 60 testers, that government or criminals agents weren't breaking into their homes to plant surveillance equipment or, far worse, to kidnap or physically harm them.

"It's very significant for them to know that they have tools they can use themselves when the government isn’t protecting them," Uribe Villegas says. "It’s great to think about cybersecurity, but in countries like ours, personal security is still at the top of our list."

The app make uses of the fron and back camera, the three microphones, light sensor, proximity sensors and accelerometer to turn your phone into 
a mini security device. All you need to do is that install the app on your phone (Even a cheap Android burner can do the job) and you are ready to go.
Haven uses the phone's cameras, microphones and even accelerometers to monitor for any motion, sound or disturbance of the phone. Leave the app running in your hotel room, for instance, and it can capture photos and audio of anyone entering the room while you're out, whether an innocent housekeeper or an intelligence agent trying to use his alone time with your laptop to install spyware on it. It can then instantly send pictures and sound clips of those visitors to your primary phone, alerting you to the disturbance. The app even uses the phone's light sensor to trigger an alert if the room goes dark, or an unexpected flashlight flickers.

The app is still in beta and the source code is opensource and hosted on github. I will leave the link in the download section below.

The app can also send message to your phone if it encounters a unusual activity and the developers are working to integrate whatsapp messaging
and all signal notifications. The app also gives the users option to tunnel the notifications through Tor network.
